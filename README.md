## Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Gerson Umanzor and I'm from El Salvador ðŸ’™.

I'm currently working as a Software Engineer using Angular.

At the moment, I am reinforcing my Front-End Skills by learning Vue.js and React. I love reading articles and learning new stuff. You can check my repository collection and if you have suggestions make sure to leave comments or contact me. I'm also trying to build reusable packages I believe the community will find useful.

If you have ideas to be implemented in the packages I have worked on, you can submit a pull request and I will review it as soon as I can.

If you have any ideas, offers or anything else you'd like to talk to me about, do not hesitate to write an email to contact@gbumanzor.dev or reach out in my social media:
